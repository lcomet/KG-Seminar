\begin{abstract}
The era of data is here and we need to deal with a big amount of data in different format representations. In order to get valuable insights from the underlying data it is necessary to extract the right portion of it to help us make sense of the data. However, this extracting process is not an easy task due to the different representations and the resulting complexity. One way of dealing with this kind of problems is using graphs for data representation.

One way of representing information, and which is getting more common is graph-based because of its benefits (\todo{look for definition of graph and benefits, see if KG allows integration of information about entities from multiple sources, and if clustering of equivalent entities from diff sources is the key factor in the construction of KG }). But it is important to analyze and compare different clustering techniques and algorithms to get the most from this kind of representation. We will present the benefits of clustering on KG. We will present some common problems on graph clustering (like overlapping or inclusion of same entity in various clusters)
It is possible to use unsupervised techniques to explore large-datasets (\todo{rephrase it})
In this paper we present an overview of the most interesting techniques and algorithms design (approaches) with the purpose of improving clustering in graphs from a semantic perspective. We will revised in detail some of those algorithms to understand better, compare them and suggest the area of use specific to every case (presenting the pros and cons), and try to suggest the future of clustering.
Clustering is a valid tool to be use in the exploration of data (big amount of data, vast)

The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in
15--250 words.

\section{Introduction}
Explain what and why is this paper here.

It is crucial to make sense of data but this task is challenged by the enormous amount of data in the era of information technology \cite{Pedrycz}.

Various fields, such as intelligent data analysis (IDA), data mining, and system modeling attempt to assist the tasks involved in the understanding of data and discovery of tendencies on data \cite{Pedrycz}.


\section{Background}
First of all, for a better understanding, it is important to define the main concepts related to the topic under study. In this section we present the core concepts associated with Knowledge Graphs and Clustering, as well as a short description of the relation between those concepts.


\subsection{Graphs}
In the formal definition of Diestel \cite{Diestel}, ``a $graph$ is a pair $G = (V, E)$ of sets satisfying $E \subseteq [V]^2$; thus, the elements of $E$ are 2-element subsets of $V$. To avoid notational ambiguities, we shall always assume tacitly that $V \cap E = \emptyset$. The elements of $V$ are the $vertices$ (or $nodes$ or $points$) of the graph $G$, the elements of $E$ are its $edges$ (or $lines$)."

In another words, a graph is a set of vertices (nodes) and edges (links) connecting those vertices. The nodes on a graph represent different entities from the real world \cite{Robinson}, while the edges depict the relationship among them.

\subsection{Knowledge Graphs}
Currently there is not a common definition of the term knowledge graphs (KG). Neither exist, as explained for Ehrlinger and W{\"o}{\ss} \cite{Ehrlinger}, an exact differentiation between the use of this term and the others related (i.e. knowledge bases, knowledge vault, and ontology). What is more, Google has its own implementation of what they call Knowledge Graph\footnote{Introducing the Knowledge Graph: things, not strings, accessed December 12, 2018,  \href{https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html}{https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not.html}}, which is an ``intelligent model" which understands some semantics and helps the search engine to create a short summary with the most relevant information related to a topic, but which does not cover all the aspects considered in a knowledge graph according to other interpretations of the term \cite{Ehrlinger}.

In the definition of Paulheim \cite{Paulheim}, ``a knowledge graph
1. mainly describes real world entities and their interrelations, organized in a graph, 2. defines possible classes and relations of entities in a schema, 3. allows for potentially interrelating arbitrary entities with each other, and 4. covers various topical domains". A more formal definition, which is also focuses more on the context of the Semantic Web, is proposed by F{\"a}rber \cite{Farber}: ``we define a Knowledge Graph as an RDF Graph. An RDF graph consists of a finite set of RDF triples where each RDF triple $(s, p, o)$ is an ordered set of the following RDF terms: a subject $s \in U ∪ B$, a predicate $p \in U$, and an object $o \in U ∪ B ∪ L$. An RDF term is either a URI $u \in U$, a blank node $b \in B$,or a literal $l \in L$. $U, B,$ and $L$ are infinite sets and pairwise disjoint".

Another definition, propose by Ehrlinger and W{\"o}{\ss} \cite{Ehrlinger} after they study on the use of the term knowledge graphs, is: ``a knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.". Moreover, they suggest that knowledge graphs involve the use of a graph-based structure to store data.


\subsection{Knowledge-based systems}
A knowledge-based system is also called an expert system, and is part of one of the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) \cite{Tripathi}. More specifically, Engelmore \cite{Engelmore} indicates that a knowledge base is part of the implementation dimension of an expert system, and that it is a database containing facts, rules, and relations. Additionally, Tripathi \cite{Tripathi} points out that expert systems aim to acquire expert knowledge coming from a human who is an specialist in the context of a particular domain, and subsequently making that information available to non-expert users.

Having an expert system can lead to benefits in handling big amounts of data, and as Engelmore \cite{Engelmore} mentions, one of the key profits is the improvement on quality of tasks related to decision making.


\subsection{Clustering}
Clustering has become a valid and well-establish tool to make sense of the big amount of data that we face nowadays, and helps to take decision based on data \cite{Pedrycz}.

The use of clustering is well-suite for a variety of application areas, for instance: engineering, economics, finance, bio-medicine, biological sciences, etc. \cite{Pedrycz}.

The optimization in clustering is predominantly data-oriented. \cite{Pedrycz}
It is required to be careful in the selection of algorithms and concepts

\subsection{Interrelation of terms}
As Engelmore \cite{Engelmore} indicates, the use of knowledge-based systems is profitable in helping decision making tasks. Likewise, implementing knowledge graphs can be beneficial, as shown by the use in industry. In this context, Pan et. al \cite{Pan}, introduce some success cases where the core idea is using knowledge graphs to collect not only data but knowledge which are then available. And whit this, to help knowledge-based search services in its information discovery and understanding.
From the Linked Data perspective, this means that the content is connected with meaning and leads to a better understanding of a topic. \cite{Pan}

\section{State of the Art}
